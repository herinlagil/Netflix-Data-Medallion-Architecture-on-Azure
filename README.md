# Netflix-Data-Medallion-Architecture-on-Azure

#Project Overview

In this project, I built an end-to-end Medallion Architecture pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold) on the Azure Data Platform using Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, and Power BI.
I used Netflix datasets from GitHub to demonstrate how to ingest, transform, and serve high-quality data for analytics.
